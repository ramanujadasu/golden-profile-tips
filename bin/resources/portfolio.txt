A great place to share your portfolio and see other people's portfolio is in our Discord community. Have a look at the Job Hunting category for all related conversation regarding portfolios, job interviews, etc... Finally, you can add your own profile including your portfolio to our student led Job Board right here: https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/ZtM-Job-Board
