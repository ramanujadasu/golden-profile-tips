Python, Java, C/C++, C#, Golang, Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript/Deno + JS Solutions!


Good news everyone! On top of the JavaScript solutions to all of the coding examples in the videos, we now have Python version of these as well! Thank to one of our fellow students, you can find it here: https://github.com/theja-m/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms  and you can find another python solution here: https://github.com/VicodinAbuser/ZTM-DS-and-Algo-Python

And now we also have C/C++ solutions as well! Thanks to another fellow student: https://github.com/shree1999/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
