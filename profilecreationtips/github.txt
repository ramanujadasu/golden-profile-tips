Optional Exercise: Github Master:
https://github.com/ramanujadasu/gitfiti

Please note that this is completely optional (mainly for fun) exercise.
Don't have a good Github history? Don't worry! If you are looking to add a little flare to your Github profile, which a lot of recruiters check, you can try using this tool: https://github.com/aneagoie/gitfiti
It will generate a file for you full of git commands which you will be able to run and design your Github history whichever way you want. Make sure you read the instructions and understand what it does!
The changes may take a few hours to take effect. If you succeeded, congrats! You just finished the easiest, and silliest exercise of this course!
If you have any questions, reach out in our private Discord chat community in the #helpme channel!

To configure new project:(go to the project folder)
git init -b main

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
$ git init -b main
Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
$ git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
$ git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
